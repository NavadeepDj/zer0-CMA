# ❓ FAQ & Services Fix - COMPLETE!

## 🎯 **Issues Fixed:**

### **Issue 1: FAQ Not Working**
- **Problem**: FAQ buttons showed but didn't work (same issue as status check)
- **Cause**: Frontend sent button text instead of action to backend
- **Solution**: Fixed button handler to send correct action

### **Issue 2: Services Info Missing Details**
- **Problem**: Services info was generic, missing specific contact details
- **Solution**: Added your specific support scope and contact information

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

### **1. FAQ Button Handling:**

#### **Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// Sent button text instead of action
} else if (action.startsWith('faq_')) {
    sendMessage(buttonText, true);  // ❌ Wrong!
}
```

#### **After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Now sends the action correctly
} else if (action.startsWith('faq_')) {
    sendMessage(action, true);  // ✅ Correct!
}
```
