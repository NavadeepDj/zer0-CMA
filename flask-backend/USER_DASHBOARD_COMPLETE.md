## 🏗️ Architecture

### Escalation Flow
```
JotForm Chatbot → User Dashboard → Enhanced Flask Chatbot → Agent Assignment
     ↓                ↓                    ↓                      ↓
Basic Support → Escalation Notice → Advanced AI → Priority Routing
```

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install firebase-admin
```

### 2. Configure Firebase (Optional)
- Set up Firebase project with Authentication enabled
- Place `firebase-service-account.json` in flask-backend/
- Update Firebase config in templates if needed

### 3. Integrate with Existing Flask App
Add to your `app.py`:
```python
from integrate_user_dashboard import integrate_user_dashboard_with_app

# After creating your Flask app
integrate_user_dashboard_with_app(app)
```

### 4. Update JotForm Embed ID
In `templates/user_dashboard.html`, update the JotForm script:
```html
<script src='https://cdn.jotfor.ms/agent/embedjs/YOUR_JOTFORM_ID/embed.js?skipWelcome=1&maximizable=1'></script>
```

### 5. Start Your Flask App
```bash
python app.py
```
